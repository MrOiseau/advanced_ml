You are provided with a PDF document. Your task is to help me create a high-quality evaluation dataset for my Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application. I need the dataset in a specific JSON format with 10 unique entries. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Extract 10 full and unique paragraphs from the provided PDF.
2. Based on each paragraph, generate a relevant question.
3. Answer each question using the paragraph as the source context.
4. The output should be formatted as JSON with the following structure:

"""
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "question": "...",
        "context": [
            "..."
        ],
        "answer": "..."
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "question": "...",
        "context": [
            "..."
        ],
        "answer": "..."
    },...
]
"""

### Rules and Tips:
- Each paragraph should be unique and cover a different aspect or section of the document.
- The questions should be diverse and naturally derived from the paragraphs.
- Make sure the answers are concise but comprehensive, directly addressing the generated questions based on the context provided.
- The dataset should be well-balanced and informative for testing retrieval-augmented language models.

The final JSON output must contain exactly 10 entries.

Now, begin extracting paragraphs, generating questions, and providing answers in the specified format.
